## Download

The app has been removed from the play store because I did not feel it was worth keeping up with the fairly unforseen frequently required updates via the play store as a result of unity's horrible app policies. Perhaps in the future I will decide I don't completely despise unity and may build the game for the web, but for now you can download the [apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oM_oq422eAloeV3q6sujMVIy08cAar5T/view?usp=drive_link) and install it for yourself if you own an android device.
