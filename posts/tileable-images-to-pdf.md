# Tileable Images To Pdf Tool

A command line tool for windows to create a PDF from tileable or normal images, filling each page with the images, and optionally skipping a page between images.

I made this tool when I was looking into some of the capabilities of AI generated images via stable diffusion and their applications. This was mainly used for generating a PDF of curated images to be used to sell on amazon, but there are some other instances where I could see this being generally useful so I decided to add additional command line arguments and make it available for everone on GitHub.

One of the more interesting use cases was taking an image that had repeatable patterns and generating a full page with the image.
