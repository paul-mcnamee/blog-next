# Creating a Life Calendar App

In general, I used flutter and firebase to create the application, and nothing was really super complicated. This was just a practical simple application that I thought I could create fairly easily while learning flutter and refreshing my knowledge of firebase along the way.

The code is also open source, so if you are interested in how something was implemented please view it on [github](https://github.com/paul-mcnamee/LifeCalendar).

Life is short and precious, and we often forget to appreciate the moments that make it meaningful. That's why I want to share with you my app that can help you visualize your life in weeks and capture your thoughts, feelings, and memories along the way. It's called **Life Calendar**, and it's available for both Android via the play store:

## What is Life Calendar?

Life Calendar is a journaling app that breaks down your life into weeks and displays them in a grid. Each week is represented by a little box. You can keep track of your todos, add a journal entry for the day, and review your previous entries.

The idea behind Life Calendar is inspired by a famous TED talk by Tim Urban, who showed how our lives can be divided into 90-year grids of 52 weeks each. He urged us to think about how we spend our time and what we want to achieve in our limited lifespan. The app allows you to change the number of years, and also lets you display months, years, or even hide the life calendar view if that is not something you want to see.

Life Calendar helps you do that by encouraging you to reflect on your past weeks and plan for your future ones. It also helps you cherish your life by creating a visual diary of your experiences, emotions, and learnings.

## Conclusion

Life Calendar is a unique and innovative app that can help you cherish your life by visualizing it in weeks and capturing your memories along the way. It's easy to use, fun to explore, and beneficial for your well-being.

If you're looking for a new way to journal your life or just want to try something different, I highly recommend giving Life Calendar a try. You might be surprised by how much you can learn about yourself and your life.

I hope this blog has inspired you to download Life Calendar and start using it today. If you have any questions or feedback about the app, feel free to contact me.

Thank you for reading and happy journaling!
